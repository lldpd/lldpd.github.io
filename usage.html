<b><span class="caps">DESCRIPTION</span></b>
     <b>lldpd</b> is a daemon able to receive and send <u><span class="caps">LLDP</span></u> frames. The Link Layer
     Discovery Protocol is a vendor-neutral Layer 2 protocol that allows a
     network device to advertise its identity and capabilities on the local
     network.

     <b>lldpd</b> also implements an <span class="caps">SNMP</span> subagent using AgentX protocol to inter-
     face to a regular <span class="caps">SNMP</span> agent like Net-<span class="caps">SNMP</span>. To enable this subagent,
     you need something like that in your snmpd.conf(5):

           master agentx

     This daemon implements both reception and sending. It will collect var-
     ious information to send <span class="caps">LLDP</span> frames to all Ethernet interfaces, in-
     cluding management address, speed and <span class="caps">VLAN</span> names.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-d</b>      Do not daemonize.  If this option is specified, <b>lldpd</b> will run
             in the foreground. When specified one more time, <b>lldpd</b> will not
             log to syslog but only to stderr. Then, this option can be
             specified many times to increase verbosity. When specified four
             times, debug logs will be enabled. They can be filtered with <b>-D</b>
             flag.

     <b>-D</b> <u>debug</u>
             This option allows the user to filter out debugging information
             by specifying allowed tokens. This option can be repeated sev-
             eral times to allow several tokens. This option must be com-
             bined with the <b>-d</b> flag to have some effect. Only debugging logs
             can be filtered. Here is a list of allowed tokens with their
             description:

                 <b>netlink</b>     Netlink subsystem.

     <b>-p</b> <u>pidfile</u>
             Use the provided <span class="caps">PID</span> file to record <b>lldpd</b> <span class="caps">PID</span> instead of
             @LLDPD_PID_FILE@.

     <b>-k</b>      Disable advertising of kernel release, version and machine.
             Kernel name (ie: Linux) will still be shared, and Inventory
             software version will be set to &#x27;Unknown&#x27;.

     <b>-S</b> <u>description</u>
             Override system description with the provided description. The
             default description is the kernel name, the node name, the ker-
             nel version, the build date and the architecture (except if you
             use the <b>-k</b> flag described above).

     <b>-P</b> <u>platform</u>
             Override the <span class="caps">CDP</span> platform name with the provided value. The de-
             fault description is the kernel name (Linux).

     <b>-x</b>      Enable <span class="caps">SNMP</span> subagent.  With this option, <b>lldpd</b> will enable an
             <span class="caps">SNMP</span> subagent using AgentX protocol. This allows you to get in-
             formation about local system and remote systems through <span class="caps">SNMP</span>.

     <b>-X</b> <u>socket</u>
             Enable <span class="caps">SNMP</span> subagent using the specified socket.  <b>lldpd</b> will
             enable an <span class="caps">SNMP</span> subagent using AgentX protocol for the given
             socket. This option implies the previous one. The default
             socket is usually <u>/var/agentx/master</u>.  You can specify a socket
             like <u>tcp:127.0.0.1:705</u> for example. Since the process that will
             open this socket is enclosed in a chroot, you need to specify
             an <span class="caps">IP</span> address (not a hostname) when using a <span class="caps">TCP</span> or <span class="caps">UDP</span> socket.

     <b>-c</b>      Enable the support of <span class="caps">CDP</span> protocol to deal with Cisco routers
             that do not speak <span class="caps">LLDP</span>. If repeated, CDPv1 packets will be sent
             even when there is no <span class="caps">CDP</span> peer detected. If repeated once
             again, CDPv2 packets will be sent even when there is no <span class="caps">CDP</span>
             peer detected. If repeated once again (i.e.  <b>-cccc</b>), CDPv1 will
             be disabled and CDPv2 will be enabled. If repeated once again
             (i.e.  <b>-ccccc</b>), CDPv1 will be disabled and CDPv2 will be
             forced.

     <b>-f</b>      Enable the support of <span class="caps">FDP</span> protocol to deal with Foundry routers
             that do not speak <span class="caps">LLDP</span>. If repeated, <span class="caps">FDP</span> packets will be sent
             even when there is no <span class="caps">FDP</span> peer detected.

     <b>-s</b>      Enable the support of <span class="caps">SONMP</span> protocol to deal with Nortel
             routers and switches that do not speak <span class="caps">LLDP</span>. If repeated, <span class="caps">SONMP</span>
             packets will be sent even when there is no <span class="caps">SONMP</span> peer detected.

     <b>-e</b>      Enable the support of <span class="caps">EDP</span> protocol to deal with Extreme routers
             and switches that do not speak <span class="caps">LLDP</span>. If repeated, <span class="caps">EDP</span> packets
             will be sent even when there is no <span class="caps">EDP</span> peer detected.

     <b>-l</b>      Force to send <span class="caps">LLDP</span> packets even when there is no <span class="caps">LLDP</span> peer de-
             tected but there is a peer speaking another protocol detected.
             By default, <span class="caps">LLDP</span> packets are sent when there is a peer speaking
             <span class="caps">LLDP</span> detected or when there is no peer at all. If repeated,
             <span class="caps">LLDP</span> is disabled.

     <b>-r</b>      Receive-only mode. With this switch, <b>lldpd</b> will not send any
             frame. It will only listen to neighbors.

     <b>-m</b> <u>management</u>
             Specify the management addresses of this system. As for inter-
             faces (described below), this option can use wildcards and in-
             versions.  Without this option, the first IPv4 and the first
             IPv6 are used. If an exact <span class="caps">IP</span> address is provided, it is used
             as a management address without any check. If only negative
             patterns are provided, only one IPv4 and one IPv6 addresses are
             chosen. Otherwise, many of them can be selected. If you want to
             remove IPv6 addresses, you can use <u>!*:*</u>.  If an interface name
             is matched, the first IPv4 address and the first IPv6 address
             associated to this interface will be chosen.

     <b>-u</b> <u>file</u>
             Specify the Unix-domain socket used for communication with
             lldpctl(8).

     <b>-I</b> <u>interfaces</u>
             Specify which interface to listen and send <span class="caps">LLDPDU</span> to. Without
             this option, <b>lldpd</b> will use all available physical interfaces.
             This option can use wildcards. Several interfaces can be speci-
             fied separated by commas.  It is also possible to remove an in-
             terface by prefixing it with an exclamation mark. It is possi-
             ble to allow an interface by prefixing it with two exclamation
             marks. An allowed interface beats a forbidden interface which
             beats a simple matched interface. For example, with
             <u>eth*,!eth1,!eth2</u> <b>lldpd</b> will only use interfaces starting by <u>eth</u>
             with the exception of <u>eth1</u> and <u>eth2</u>.  While with <u>*,!eth*,!!eth1</u>
             <b>lldpd</b> will use all interfaces, except interfaces starting by
             <u>eth</u> with the exception of <u>eth1</u>.  When an exact match is found,
             it will circumvent some tests. For example, if <u>eth0.12</u> is spec-
             ified, it will be accepted even if this is a <span class="caps">VLAN</span> interface.

     <b>-C</b> <u>interfaces</u>
             Specify which interfaces to use for computing chassis <span class="caps">ID</span>. With-
             out this option, all interfaces are considered.  <b>lldpd</b> will
             take the first <span class="caps">MAC</span> address from all the considered interfaces
             to compute the chassis <span class="caps">ID</span>. The logic of this option is the same
             as for <b>-I</b> flag: you can exclude interfaces with an exclamation
             mark and use globbing to specify several interfaces. If all in-
             terfaces are removed (with <u>!*</u>), the system name is used as a
             chassis <span class="caps">ID</span> instead.

     <b>-M</b> <u>class</u>
             Enable emission of <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> frame. Depending on the selected
             class, the standard defines which set of <span class="caps">TLV</span> should be trans-
             mitted. See section 10.2.1. Some devices may be strict about
             this aspect. The class should be one of the following value:
             <b>1</b>     Generic Endpoint (Class I)
             <b>2</b>     Media Endpoint (Class <span class="caps">II</span>). In this case, the standard re-
                   quires to define at least one network policy through
                   <b>lldpcli</b>.
             <b>3</b>     Communication Device Endpoints (Class <span class="caps">III</span>). In this case,
                   the standard requires to define at least one network pol-
                   icy through <b>lldpcli</b>.
             <b>4</b>     Network Connectivity Device

     <b>-i</b>      Disable <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> inventory <span class="caps">TLV</span> transmission.  <b>lldpd</b> will still
             receive (and publish using <span class="caps">SNMP</span> if enabled) those <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> <span class="caps">TLV</span>
             but will not send them. Use this option if you don&#x27;t want to
             transmit sensible information like serial numbers.

     <b>-H</b> <u>hide</u>
             Filter neighbors. See section <u><span class="caps">FILTERING</span></u> <u><span class="caps">NEIGHBORS</span></u> for details.

     <b>-L</b> <u>lldpcli</u>
             Provide an alternative path to <b>lldpcli</b> for configuration. If
             empty, does not use <b>lldpcli</b> for configuration.

     <b>-O</b> <u>configfile</u>
             Override default configuration locations processed by <b>lldpcli</b>
             at start. If a directory is provided, each file contained in it
             will be read if ending by <b>.conf.</b> Order is alphabetical.

     <b>-v</b>      Show <b>lldpd</b> version. When repeated, show more build information.

<b><span class="caps">FILTERING</span></b> <b><span class="caps">NEIGHBORS</span></b>
     In a heterogeneous network, you may see several different hosts on the
     same port, even if there is only one physically plugged to this port.
     For example, if you have a Nortel switch running <span class="caps">LLDP</span> which is plugged
     to a Cisco switch running <span class="caps">CDP</span> and your host is plugged to the Cisco
     switch, you will see the Nortel switch as well because <span class="caps">LLDP</span> frames are
     forwarded by the Cisco switch. This may not be what you want. The <b>-H</b>
     <u>hide</u> parameter will allow you to tell <b>lldpd</b> to discard some frames that
     it receives and to avoid to send some other frames.

     Incoming filtering and outgoing filtering are unrelated. Incoming fil-
     tering will hide some remote ports to get you a chance to know exactly
     what equipment is on the other side of the network cable. Outgoing fil-
     tering will avoid to use some protocols to avoid flooding your network
     with a protocol that is not handled by the nearest equipment. Keep in
     mind that even without filtering, <b>lldpd</b> will speak protocols for which
     at least one frame has been received and <span class="caps">LLDP</span> otherwise (there are
     other options to change this behaviour, for example <b>-cc</b>, <b>-ss</b>, <b>-ee</b>, <b>-ll</b>
     and <b>-ff</b> ).

     When enabling incoming filtering, <b>lldpd</b> will try to select one protocol
     and filter out neighbors using other protocols. To select this proto-
     col, the rule is to take the less used protocol. If on one port, you
     get 12 <span class="caps">CDP</span> neighbors and 1 <span class="caps">LLDP</span> neighbor, this mean that the remote
     switch speaks <span class="caps">LLDP</span> and does not filter <span class="caps">CDP</span>. Therefore, we select <span class="caps">LLDP</span>.
     When enabling outgoing filtering, <b>lldpd</b> will also try to select one
     protocol and only speaks this protocol. The filtering is done per port.
     Each port may select a different protocol.

     There are two additional criteria when enabling filtering: allowing one
     or several protocols to be selected (in case of a tie) and allowing one
     or several neighbors to be selected. Even when allowing several proto-
     cols, the rule of selecting the protocols with the less neighbors still
     apply. If <b>lldpd</b> selects <span class="caps">LLDP</span> and <span class="caps">CDP</span>, this means they have the same
     number of neighbors. The selection of the neighbor is random. Incoming
     filtering will select a set of neighbors to be displayed while outgoing
     filtering will use the selected set of neighbors to decide which proto-
     cols to use: if a selected neighbor speaks <span class="caps">LLDP</span> and another one <span class="caps">CDP</span>,
     <b>lldpd</b> will speak both <span class="caps">CDP</span> and <span class="caps">LLDP</span> on this port.

     There are some corner cases. A typical example is a switch speaking two
     protocols (<span class="caps">CDP</span> and <span class="caps">LLDP</span> for example). You want to get the information
     from the best protocol but you want to speak both protocols because
     some tools use the <span class="caps">CDP</span> table and some other the <span class="caps">LLDP</span> table.

     The table below summarize all accepted values for the <b>-H</b> <u>hide</u> parame-
     ter. The default value is <u>15</u> which corresponds to the corner case de-
     scribed above. The <u>filter</u> column means that filtering is enabled. The
     <u>1proto</u> column tells that only one protocol will be kept. The <u>1neigh</u>
     column tells that only one neighbor will be kept.

<b><span class="caps">SYNOPSIS</span></b>
     <b>lldpcli</b> [<b>-dv</b>] [<b>-u</b> <u>socket</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>format</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>file</u>] [<u>command</u> <u>&#8230;</u>]

<b><span class="caps">DESCRIPTION</span></b>
     The <b>lldpcli</b> program controls lldpd(8) daemon.

     When no command is specified, <b>lldpcli</b> will start an interactive shell
     which can be used to input arbitrary commands as if they were specified
     on the command line. This interactive shell should provide completion
     and history support.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-d</b>      Enable more debugging information. This flag can be repeated.

     <b>-u</b> <u>socket</u>
             Specify the Unix-domain socket used for communication with
             lldpd(8).

     <b>-v</b>      Show <b>lldpcli</b> version. When repeated, show more build informa-
             tion.

     <b>-f</b> <u>format</u>
             Choose the output format. Currently <u>plain</u>, <u>xml</u>, <u>json</u>, <u>json0</u> and
             <u>keyvalue</u> formats are available. The default is <u>plain</u>.  <u>json0</u> is
             more verbose than <u>json</u> but the structure of the <span class="caps">JSON</span> object is
             not affected by the number of interfaces or the number of
             neighbors. It is therefore easier to parse.

     <b>-c</b> <u>file</u>
             Read the given configuration file. This option may be repeated
             several times. If a directory is provided, each file contained
             in it will be read  if ending by .conf.  Order is alphabetical.

     When invoked as <b>lldpctl</b>, <b>lldpcli</b> will display detailed information
     about each neighbors on the specified interfaces or on all interfaces
     if none are specified. This command is mostly kept for backward compat-
     ibility with older versions.

     The following commands are supported by <b>lldpcli</b>.  When there is no am-
     biguity, the keywords can be abbreviated. For example, <b>show</b> <b>neighbors</b>
     <b>ports</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>summary</b> and <b>sh</b> <b>neigh</b> <b>p</b> <b>eth0</b> <b>sum</b> are the same command.

       <b>exit</b>

             Quit <b>lldpcli</b>.

       <b>help</b> [&#8230;]

             Display general help or help about a command. Also, you can get
             help using the completion or by pressing the ?  key. However,
             completion and inline help may be unavailable if <b>lldpcli</b> was
             compiled without readline support but <b>help</b> command is always
             available.

       <b>show</b> <b>neighbors</b> [ports <u>ethX</u> [,&#8230;]] [<b>details</b> | <b>summary</b>] [<b>hidden</b>]

             Display information about each neighbor known by lldpd(8) dae-
             mon. With <b>summary</b>, only the name and the port description of
             each remote host will be displayed. On the other hand, with
             <b>details</b>, all available information will be displayed, giving a
             verbose view. When using <b>hidden</b>, also display remote ports hid-
             den by the smart filter. When specifying one or several ports,
             the information displayed is limited to the given list of
             ports.

       <b>show</b> <b>interfaces</b> [ports <u>ethX</u> [,&#8230;]] [<b>details</b> | <b>summary</b>] [<b>hidden</b>]

             Display information about each local interface known by
             lldpd(8) daemon. With <b>summary</b>, only the name and the port de-
             scription of each local interface will be displayed. On the
             other hand, with <b>details</b>, all available information will be
             displayed, giving a verbose view. When using <b>hidden</b>, also dis-
             play local ports hidden by the smart filter. When specifying
             one or several ports, the information displayed is limited to
             the given list of ports.

       <b>show</b> <b>chassis</b> [<b>details</b> | <b>summary</b>]

             Display information about local chassis. With <b>summary</b>, most de-
             tails are skipped. On the other hand, with <b>details</b>, all avail-
             able information will be displayed, giving a verbose view.

       <b>watch</b> [ports <u>ethX</u> [,&#8230;]] [<b>details</b> | <b>summary</b>] [<b>hidden</b>] [<b>limit</b> <u>X</u>]

             Watch for any neighbor changes and report them as soon as they
             happen. When specifying ports, the changes are only reported
             when happening on the given ports.  <b>hidden</b>, <b>summary</b> and <b>details</b>
             have the same meaning than previously described. If <b>limit</b> is
             specified, <b>lldpcli</b> will exit after receiving the specified num-
             ber of events.

       <b>show</b> <b>configuration</b>

             Display global configuration of lldpd(8) daemon.

       <b>show</b> <b>statistics</b> [ports <u>ethX</u> [,&#8230;]] [<b>summary</b>]

             Report <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-related statistics, like the number of <span class="caps">LLDPDU</span>
             transmitted, received, discarded or unrecognized. When specify-
             ing ports, only the statistics from the given port are re-
             ported. With <b>summary</b> the statistics of each port is summed.

       <b>update</b>

             Make lldpd(8) update its information and send new <span class="caps">LLDP</span> <span class="caps">PDU</span> on
             all interfaces.

       <b>configure</b> <b>system</b> <b>hostname</b> <u>name</u>

             Override system hostname with the provided value. By default,
             the system name is the <span class="caps">FQDN</span> found from the resolved value of
             <b>uname</b> <b>-n</b>.  As a special value, use &quot;.&quot; (dot) to use the short
             hostname instead of a <span class="caps">FQDN</span>.

       <b>unconfigure</b> <b>system</b> <b>hostname</b>

             Do not override system hostname and restore the use of the node
             name.

       <b>configure</b> <b>system</b> <b>description</b> <u>description</u>

             Override chassis description with the provided value instead of
             using kernel name, node name, kernel version, build date and
             architecture.

       <b>unconfigure</b> <b>system</b> <b>description</b>

             Do not override chassis description and use a value computed
             from node name, kernel name, kernel version, build date and ar-
             chitecture instead.

       <b>configure</b> <b>system</b> <b>chassisid</b> <u>description</u>

             Override chassis <span class="caps">ID</span> with the provided value instead of using
             <span class="caps">MAC</span> address from one interface or host name.

       <b>unconfigure</b> <b>system</b> <b>chassisid</b>

             Do not override chassis <span class="caps">ID</span> and use a value computed from one of
             the interface <span class="caps">MAC</span> address (or host name if none is found).

       <b>configure</b> <b>system</b> <b>platform</b> <u>description</u>

             Override platform description with the provided value instead
             of using kernel name. This value is currently only used for
             <span class="caps">CDP</span>.

       <b>unconfigure</b> <b>system</b> <b>platform</b>

             Do not override platform description and use the kernel name.
             This option undoes the previous one.

       <b>configure</b> <b>system</b> <b>interface</b> <b>pattern</b> <u>pattern</u>

             Specify which interface to listen and send <span class="caps">LLDPDU</span> to. Without
             this option, <b>lldpd</b> will use all available physical interfaces.
             This option can use wildcards. Several interfaces can be speci-
             fied separated by commas.  It is also possible to remove an in-
             terface by prefixing it with an exclamation mark. It is possi-
             ble to allow an interface by prefixing it with two exclamation
             marks. An allowed interface beats a forbidden interfaces which
             beats a simple matched interface. For example, with
             <u>eth*,!eth1,!eth2</u> <b>lldpd</b> will only use interfaces starting by <u>eth</u>
             with the exception of <u>eth1</u> and <u>eth2</u>.  While with <u>*,!eth*,!!eth1</u>
             <b>lldpcli</b> will use all interfaces, except interfaces starting by
             <u>eth</u> with the exception of <u>eth1</u>.  When an exact match is found,
             it will circumvent some tests. For example, if <u>eth0.12</u> is spec-
             ified, it will be accepted even if this is a <span class="caps">VLAN</span> interface.

       <b>unconfigure</b> <b>system</b> <b>interface</b> <b>pattern</b>

             Remove any previously configured interface pattern and use all
             physical interfaces. This option undoes the previous one.

       <b>configure</b> <b>system</b> <b>interface</b> <b>permanent</b> <u>pattern</u>

             Specify interfaces whose configuration is permanently kept by
             <b>lldpd</b>.  By default, <b>lldpd</b> disregard any data about interfaces
             when they are removed from the system (statistics, custom con-
             figuration). This option allows one to specify a pattern simi-
             lar to the interface pattern. If an interface disappear but
             matches the pattern, its data is kept in memory and reused if
             the interface reappear at some point. For example, on Linux,
             one could use the pattern <u>eth*,eno*,enp*</u>, which should match
             fixed interfaces on most systems.

       <b>unconfigure</b> <b>system</b> <b>interface</b> <b>permanent</b>

             Remove any previously configured permanent interface pattern.
             Any interface removed from the system will be forgotten. This
             option undoes the previous one.

       <b>configure</b> <b>system</b> <b>interface</b> <b>description</b>

             Some <span class="caps">OS</span> allows the user to set a description for an interface.
             Setting this option will enable <b>lldpd</b> to override this descrip-
             tion with the name of the peer neighbor if one is found or with
             the number of neighbors found.

       <b>unconfigure</b> <b>system</b> <b>interface</b> <b>description</b>

             Do not update interface description with the name of the peer
             neighbor. This option undoes the previous one.

       <b>configure</b> <b>system</b> <b>interface</b> <b>promiscuous</b>

             Enable promiscuous mode on managed interfaces.

             When the interface is not managed any more (or when quitting
             <b>lldpd</b>), the interface is left in promiscuous mode as it is dif-
             ficult to know if someone else also put the interface in pro-
             miscuous mode.

             This option is known to be useful when the remote switch is a
             Cisco 2960 and the local network card features <span class="caps">VLAN</span> hardware
             acceleration. In this case, you may not receive <span class="caps">LLDP</span> frames
             from the remote switch. The most plausible explanation for this
             is the frame is tagged with some <span class="caps">VLAN</span> (usually <span class="caps">VLAN</span> 1) and your
             network card is filtering <span class="caps">VLAN</span>. This is not the only available
             solution to work-around this problem. If you are concerned
             about performance issues, you can also tag the <span class="caps">VLAN</span> 1 on each
             interface instead.

             Currently, this option has no effect on anything else than
             Linux. On other <span class="caps">OS</span>, either disable <span class="caps">VLAN</span> acceleration, tag <span class="caps">VLAN</span>
             1 or enable promiscuous mode manually on the interface.

       <b>unconfigure</b> <b>system</b> <b>interface</b> <b>promiscuous</b>

             Do not set promiscuous mode on managed interfaces. This option
             does not disable promiscuous mode on interfaces already using
             this mode.

       <b>configure</b> <b>system</b> <b>ip</b> <b>management</b> <b>pattern</b> <u>pattern</u>

             Specify the management addresses of this system. As for inter-
             faces (described above), this option can use wildcards and in-
             versions.  Without this option, the first IPv4 and the first
             IPv6 are used. If an exact <span class="caps">IP</span> address is provided, it is used
             as a management address without any check. If only negative
             patterns are provided, only one IPv4 and one IPv6 addresses are
             chosen. Otherwise, many of them can be selected. If you want to
             remove IPv6 addresses, you can use <u>!*:*</u>.  If an interface name
             is matched, the first IPv4 address and the first IPv6 address
             associated to this interface will be chosen.

       <b>unconfigure</b> <b>system</b> <b>ip</b> <b>management</b> <b>pattern</b>

             Unset any specific pattern for matching management addresses.
             This option undoes the previous one.

       <b>configure</b> <b>system</b> <b>bond-slave-src-mac-type</b> <u>value</u>

             Set the type of src mac in lldp frames sent on bond slaves

             Valid types are:
               <b>real</b>  Slave real mac
               <b>zero</b>  All zero mac
               <b>fixed</b>
                     An arbitrary fixed value (00:60:08:69:97:ef)
               <b>local</b>
                     Real mac with locally administered bit set. If the real
                     mac already has the locally administered bit set, fall-
                     back to the fixed value.

             Default value for <b>bond-slave-src-mac-type</b> is <b>local</b>.  Some
             switches may complain when using one of the two other possible
             values (either because 00:00:00:00:00:00 is not a valid <span class="caps">MAC</span> or
             because the <span class="caps">MAC</span> address is flapping from one port to another).
             Using <b>local</b> might lead to a duplicate <span class="caps">MAC</span> address on the net-
             work (but this is quite unlikely).

       <b>configure</b> <b>system</b> <b>max-neighbors</b> <u>neighbors</u>

             Change the maximum number of neighbors accepted (for each pro-
             tocol) on an interface. This is a global value. The default is
             32. This setting only applies to future neighbors.

       <b>configure</b> <b>lldp</b> <b>agent-type</b> <b>nearest-bridge</b> | <b>nearest-non-tpmr-bridge</b> |
       <b>nearest-customer-bridge</b>

             The destination <span class="caps">MAC</span> address used to send <span class="caps">LLDPDU</span> allows an agent
             to control the propagation of LLDPDUs. By default, the
             01:80:c2:00:00:0e <span class="caps">MAC</span> address is used and limit the propagation
             of the <span class="caps">LLDPDU</span> to the nearest bridge (<b>nearest-bridge</b>).  To in-
             struct <b>lldpd</b> to use the 01:80:c2:00:00:03 <span class="caps">MAC</span> address instead,
             use <b>nearest-nontpmr-bridge</b> instead.  To use the
             01:80:c2:00:00:00 <span class="caps">MAC</span> address instead, use
             <b>nearest-customer-bridge</b> instead.

       <b>configure</b> <b>lldp</b> <b>portidsubtype</b> <b>ifname</b> | <b>macaddress</b>

       <b>configure</b> [ports <u>ethX</u> [,&#8230;]] <b>lldp</b> <b>portidsubtype</b> <b>local</b> <u>value</u>

             Force port <span class="caps">ID</span> subtype. By default, <b>lldpd</b> will use the <span class="caps">MAC</span> ad-
             dress as port identifier and the interface name as port de-
             scription, unless the interface has an alias. In this case, the
             interface name will be used as port identifier and the descrip-
             tion will be the interface alias. With this command, you can
             force the port identifier to be the interface name (with
             <b>ifname</b>), the <span class="caps">MAC</span> address (with <b>macaddress</b>) or a local value
             (with <b>value</b>).  In the latest case, the local value should be
             provided.

       <b>configure</b> [ports <u>ethX</u> [,&#8230;]] <b>lldp</b> <b>portdescription</b> <u>description</u>

             Force port description to the provided string.

       <b>configure</b> <b>lldp</b> <b>tx-interval</b> <u>interval</u>

             Change transmit delay to the specified value in seconds. The
             transmit delay is the delay between two transmissions of <span class="caps">LLDP</span>
             <span class="caps">PDU</span>. The default value is 30 seconds. Note: <b>lldpd</b> also starts
             another system based refresh timer on each port to detect
             changes such as a hostname. This is the value of the tx-inter-
             val multiplied by 20.

             You can specify an <b>interval</b> value in milliseconds by appending
             a &quot;ms&quot; suffix to the figure (e.g.  &quot;configure lldp tx-interval
             1500ms&quot; is 1.5s, not 1500s). In this case the <span class="caps">TTL</span> for received
             and sent <span class="caps">LLDP</span> frames is rounded up to the next second. Note:
             the effective interval can be limited by the operating system
             capabilities and <span class="caps">CPU</span> speed.

       <b>configure</b> <b>lldp</b> <b>tx-hold</b> <u>hold</u>

             Change transmit hold value to the specified value. This value
             is used to compute the <span class="caps">TTL</span> of transmitted packets which is the

             value is 4 and therefore the default <span class="caps">TTL</span> is 120 seconds.

       <u>tx-only</u> | <u>disabled</u>

             Configure the administrative status of the given port. By de-
             fault, all ports are configured to be in <u>rx-and-tx</u> mode. This
             means they can receive and transmit <span class="caps">LLDP</span> frames (as well as
             other protocols if needed). In <u>rx-only</u> mode, they won&#x27;t emit
             any frames and in <u>tx-only</u> mode, they won&#x27;t receive any frames.
             In <u>disabled</u> mode, no frame will be sent and any incoming frame
             will be discarded. This setting does not override the opera-
             tional mode of the main daemon. If it is configured in receive-
             only mode (with the <b>-r</b> flag), setting any transmit mode won&#x27;t
             have any effect.

             ally with the bytes specified in <u>content</u>.  Both <u>oui</u> and <u>content</u>
             should be a comma-separated list of bytes in hex format.  <u>oui</u>
             must be exactly 3-byte long.  If <u>add</u> is specified then the <span class="caps">TLV</span>
             will be added. This is the default action.  If <u>replace</u> is spec-
             ified then all TLVs with the same <u>oui</u> and <u>subtype</u> will be re-
             placed.

             ond. Once 4 <span class="caps">LLDPDU</span> have been sent, the fast start mechanism is
             disabled until a new neighbor is detected.

             Advertise a coordinate based location on the given ports (or on
             all ports if no port is specified). The format of <u>latitude</u> is a
             decimal floating point number followed either by <u>N</u> or <u>S</u>.  The
             format of <u>longitude</u> is a decimal floating point number followed
             either by <u>E</u> or <u>W</u>.  <u>altitude</u> is a decimal floating point number
             followed either by <u>m</u> when expressed in meters or <u>f</u> when ex-
             pressed in floors. A space is expected between the floating
             point number and the unit.  <u>datum</u> is one of those values:

             if no port is specified).  <u>country</u> is the two-letter code rep-
             resenting the country. The remaining arguments should be paired
             to form the address. The first member of each pair indicates

       <b>configure</b> [ports <u>ethX</u> [,&#8230;]] <b>med</b> <b>location</b> <b>elin</b> <u>number</u>

             Advertise the availability of an <span class="caps">ELIN</span> number. This is used for
             setting up emergency call. If the provided number is too small,
             it will be padded with 0. Here is an example of use:
                   configure ports eth2 med location elin 911

             Advertise a specific network policy for the given ports (or for
             all ports if no port was provided). Only the application type
             is mandatory.  <u>application</u> should be one of the following val-
             ues:
                     &raquo;   voice
                     &raquo;   voice-signaling

                     &raquo;   streaming-video
                     &raquo;   video-signaling

             The <b>unknown</b> flag tells that the network policy for the speci-
             fied application type is required by the device but is cur-
             rently unknown. This is used by Endpoint Devices, not by Net-
             work Connectivity Devices. If not specified, the network policy
             for the given application type is defined.

             When a <span class="caps">VLAN</span> is specified with <u>vlan</u> tells which 802.1q <span class="caps">VLAN</span> <span class="caps">ID</span>
             has to be advertised for the network policy. A valid value is
             between 1 and 4094.  <b>tagged</b> tells the <span class="caps">VLAN</span> should be tagged for
             the specified application type.

             <u>priority</u> allows one to specify <span class="caps">IEEE</span> 802.1d / <span class="caps">IEEE</span> 802.1p Layer
             2 Priority, also known as Class of Service (CoS), to be used
             for the specified application type. This field is usually ig-
             nored if no <span class="caps">VLAN</span> is specified. The names match 802.1D-2004
             standard (table G-2). Some more recent standards may use dif-
             ferent labels. Only the numeric values should be relied upon.
             The accepted labels are:
                 <b>1</b>   background
                 <b>0</b>   best-effort
                 <b>2</b>   excellent-effort
                 <b>3</b>   critical-applications
                 <b>4</b>   video
                 <b>5</b>   voice
                 <b>6</b>   internetwork-control
                 <b>7</b>   network-control

             <u>dscp</u> represents the <span class="caps">DSCP</span> value to be advertised for the given
             network policy.  DiffServ/Differentiated Services Code Point
             (<span class="caps">DSCP</span>) value as defined in <span class="caps">IETF</span> <span class="caps">RFC</span> 2474 for the specified ap-
             plication type. Value: 0 (default per <span class="caps">RFC</span> 2475) through 63.
             Note: The class selector <span class="caps">DSCP</span> values are backwards compatible
             for devices that only support the old <span class="caps">IP</span> precedence Type of
             Service (ToS) format. (See the RFCs for what these values mean)

             A valid use of this command is:

             (power consumer) or a <span class="caps">PSE</span> (power provider). No check is done on
             the validity of the parameters while <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> requires some re-
             strictions:

             &raquo;   <span class="caps">PD</span> shall never request more power than physical 802.3af
                 class.

             &raquo;   <span class="caps">PD</span> shall never draw more than the maximum power advertised
                 by <span class="caps">PSE</span>.

             &raquo;   <span class="caps">PSE</span> shall not reduce power allocated to <span class="caps">PD</span> when this power
                 is in use.

             &raquo;   <span class="caps">PSE</span> may request reduced power using conservation mode

             &raquo;   Being <span class="caps">PSE</span> or <span class="caps">PD</span> is a global parameter, not a per-port pa-
                 rameter.  <b>lldpcli</b> does not enforce this: a port can be set
                 as <span class="caps">PD</span> or <span class="caps">PSE</span>. <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> also requires for a <span class="caps">PSE</span> to only have
                 one power source (primary or backup). Again, <b>lldpcli</b> does
                 not enforce this. Each port can have its own power source.
                 The same applies for <span class="caps">PD</span> and power priority. <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> <span class="caps">MIB</span>
                 does not allow this kind of representation.

             Valid types are:
               <b>pse</b>   Power Sourcing Entity (power provider)
               <b>pd</b>    Power Device (power consumer)

             Valid sources are:
               <b>unknown</b>  Unknown
               <b>primary</b>  For <span class="caps">PSE</span>, the power source is the primary power
                        source.
               <b>backup</b>   For <span class="caps">PSE</span>, the power source is the backup power source
                        or a power conservation mode is asked (the <span class="caps">PSE</span> may
                        be running on <span class="caps">UPS</span> for example).
               <b>pse</b>      For <span class="caps">PD</span>, the power source is the <span class="caps">PSE</span>.
               <b>local</b>    For <span class="caps">PD</span>, the power source is a local source.
               <b>both</b>     For <span class="caps">PD</span>, the power source is both the <span class="caps">PSE</span> and a local
                        source.

             Valid priorities are:

             <u>value</u> should be the total power in milliwatts required by the
             <span class="caps">PD</span> device or available by the <span class="caps">PSE</span> device.

             Here is an example of use:

             if none was provided. One can act as a <span class="caps">PD</span> (power consumer) or a
             <span class="caps">PSE</span> (power provider). This configuration is distinct of the
             configuration of the transmission of the <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> <span class="caps">POE</span>-<span class="caps">MDI</span> <span class="caps">TLV</span>
             but the user should ensure the coherency of those two configu-
             rations if they are used together.

             <u>supported</u> means that <span class="caps">MDI</span> power is supported on the given port
             while <u>enabled</u> means that <span class="caps">MDI</span> power is enabled.  <u>paircontrol</u> is
             used to indicate if pair selection can be controlled. Valid
             values for <u>powerpairs</u> are:
               <b>signal</b>  The signal pairs only are in use.
               <b>spare</b>   The spare pairs only are in use.

             When specified, <u>class</u> is a number between 0 and 4.

             The remaining parameters are in conformance with 802.3at and
             are optional.  <u>type</u> should be either 1 or 2, indicating which
             if the device conforms to 802.3at type 1 or 802.3at type 2.
             Values of <u>source</u> and <u>priority</u> are the same as for <span class="caps">LLDP</span>-<span class="caps">MED</span> <span class="caps">POE</span>-
             <span class="caps">MDI</span> <span class="caps">TLV</span>.  <u>requested</u> and <u>allocated</u> are expressed in milliwats.
